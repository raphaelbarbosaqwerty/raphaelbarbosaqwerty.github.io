### The blog objective

Always I want to write some stuffs about my advances in life, career, studies and now I'm here. And I'll use as a living curriculum too.

I have the idea to share my advances/knowledge in:
- Pentesting/CTF's (Write-ups about rooted boxes).
- Programming (Just for Studies).
- Personal Development (Books reviews).

### Books

I have a Repo in GitHub about some books I read, but I'll bring to here all these books and some reviews. If you want to recommend a good books for me, just make a pull request on my [Repository](https://github.com/raphaelbarbosaqwerty/BookStudy)
