## Sharing

After some weeks that I launched my new version of the blog version on Flutter I decided to share the source with the community for studies. And here we are, you can check the source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/raphaelbarbosaqwerty/Blog-Flutter-web-markdown).
- Have found some bug? Please make a PR/issue.
- I accept any tips just send a message on my LinkedIn or open an PR in the repository.

Thanks!
