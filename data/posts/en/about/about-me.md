- Docker.
  
### Swift/Ionic

Working with a company to development App using
- Swift (Company, but the project was changed).  
    -> Big challenge when I started with Swift, because I nothing about the language. I used one month to study and 2-3 for the App but the projest was changed to Flutter.
   
Used Ionic just for studies, if you want to check the App:

### Fluter/Dart

- Flutter (Company and as Freelancer).  
-> We start to structure the architecture of the App, the big challenge here was to manage the State, because of this we start with BLoC but the MobX calls more attention because of is more scalable.  
-> App: Consuming API, BLoC.  
-> My next projects I'll be with Mobx because of the scalability.
